# To define a base class called Animal with a method make_sound(). Implement derived classes like Dog, Cat, Bird that override the make_sound() method to produce different sounds. Demonstrate polymorphism by calling the method on objects of different classes

class Animal:
    def make_sound(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement abstract method 'make_sound'")

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof! Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

class Bird(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Chirp! Chirp!"

# Demonstrating polymorphism
print("\n--- Polymorphism Demonstration ---")

for animal in animals:
