# To write a NumPy program using NumPy methods â€“ max, min, argmax, argmin, repr, count, bincount, unique.
# (a) To extract all numbers from a given array which are less and greater than a specific number

import numpy as np

# Create a sample NumPy array
data = np.array([19, 7, 2, 11, 54, 72, 23, 9, 17])

# Define the range to filter by
min_val = 10
max_val = 20

print("Original array:", data)
print(f"Filtering for numbers between {min_val} and {max_val}...")

# Use boolean indexing to create a mask for elements in the range
filtered_data = data[(data > min_val) & (data < max_val)]
